Book reports are short articles (about 400 words) that are written by specialists and read by the general community.
The aim of a Book report is to give a brief summary of the book's strengths and weaknesses and to evaluate the
book's overall usefulness to the audience it is intended for.

Here are some questions you might want to consider:

* Who is the book intended for and does it meet the intended audience's needs?
* What new information does it present and how might it affect the readers' practice?
* What evidence does it present and how convincing is it?
* Is the style, organization and size of the book appropriate for its purpose?
* Are there any studies, facts, or ideas the authors have neglected to consider?
* Would you like to make any further reading suggestions?
* And last but not least: Why should anybody read this book - or why should they not? Is it an important book?
