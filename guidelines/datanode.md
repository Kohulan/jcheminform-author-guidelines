**_Journal of Cheminformatics_ will only publish research or software that is entirely reproducible by third parties.
This means that any datasets, software and algorithms that are required to reach the conclusions stated in the
paper must be provided as supplemental materials, or be otherwise accessible without the need for registration,
login or agreement with license terms other than Creative Commons licenses for data and text and
[OSI-approved Open Source Licenses](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)
for software. For any software, the source code must be provided.**

Data articles should describe a curated, CCZero or CC-BY-licensed dataset likely to be of broad utility. The dataset must
be curated as detailed in this publication and archived for long-term reuse. A Data article describes the content
of the data set, the method used to curate the data, and a description of how the dataset deposition complies with
the FAIR principles. Unlike with a Database paper, a Data paper focuses on the data itself and not how the data
can be graphically or otherwise explored.

Data articles should include an abstract that does not exceed 350 words.

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the reader with a
visual description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical abstract should be 920 x 300
pixels and a maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are encouraged to make judicious use of colour in
graphical abstracts. All graphical abstracts should have a white background and where possible should fill the
available width.
