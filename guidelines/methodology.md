**_Journal of Cheminformatics_ will only publish research or software that is entirely reproducible by third parties.
This means that any datasets, software and algorithms that are required to reach the conclusions stated in the paper
must be provided as supplemental materials, or be otherwise accessible without the need for registration, login or 
agreement with license terms other than Creative Commons licenses for data and text and 
[OSI-approved Open Source Licenses](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)
for software. For any software, the source code must be provided.**

Methodologies should present a new experimental or computational method, test or procedure. The method described may
either be completely new, or may offer a better version of an existing method. The article must describe a demonstrable
advance on what is currently available. The method needs to have been well tested and ideally, but not necessarily, used
in a way that proves its value.

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the reader with a visual
description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical abstract should be 920 x 300 pixels and a
maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are encouraged to make judicious use of colour in graphical abstracts.
All graphical abstracts should have a white background and where possible should fill the available width.
