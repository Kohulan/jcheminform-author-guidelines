Review articles are summaries of recent insights in specific research areas within the scope of
_Journal of Cheminformatics_.

Key aims of Reviews are to provide systematic and substantial coverage of mature subjects, evaluations of progress in
specified areas, and/or critical assessments of emerging technologies.

Review should be approximately 3000 words.

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the reader with a visual
description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical abstract should be 920 x 300 pixels and a
maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are encouraged to make judicious use of colour in graphical abstracts.
All graphical abstracts should have a white background and where possible should fill the available width.
