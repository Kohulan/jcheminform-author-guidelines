These short, narrowly focused articles of contemporary interest are usually commissioned by the journal. They are not
minireviews. A Commentary generally takes one of two forms:

• The first form is a discussion of an article or trial that was recently published or that is soon to be
  published, and that is interesting enough to warrant further comment or explanation. This type of Commentary
  discusses specific issues within a subject area rather than the whole field, explains the implications of
  the article and puts it in context. Opinions are welcome as long as they are factually based.
  
• The second form is more editorial in nature and covers an aspect of an issue that is relevant to the
  journal's scope. Examples of this type of Commentary could be a discussion of the impact of new technology
  on research and treatment, or a discussion of changes in peer review or grant application procedures and their
  effect on research. By their nature, the second form of Commentary is less frequent.

Commentary articles should be between 800 and 1,200 words with an abstract that should not exceed 350 words.
