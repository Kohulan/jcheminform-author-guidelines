**_Journal of Cheminformatics_ will only publish research or software that is entirely reproducible by third parties.
This means that any datasets, software and algorithms that are required to reach the conclusions stated in the paper must
be provided as supplemental materials, or be otherwise accessible without the need for registration, login or agreement
with license terms other than Creative Commons licenses for data and text and
[OSI-approved Open Source Licenses](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)
for software. For any software, the source code must be provided.**

Software articles should describe a tool likely to be of broad utility that represents a significant advance over
previously published software (usually demonstrated by direct comparison with available related software).

**Availability of software to reviewers and other researchers**

The software application/tool described in the manuscript must be available for testing by reviewers in a way that
preserves their anonymity. If published, software applications/tools must be freely and anonymously available under
an [OSI-approved Open Source](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license to any researcher wishing to
use them for non-commercial purposes, without restrictions such
as the need for a material transfer agreement or a registration to access the package. Because weblinks frequently
become broken, _Journal of Cheminformatics_ strongly recommends that all software applications/tools are included
with the submitted manuscript as additional files to ensure that the software will continue to be available.
If not possible, weblinks should be archived in the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/save).

_Journal of Cheminformatics_ requires that the source code of the software should be made available under a suitable
open-source license that will entitle other researchers to further develop and extend the software if they wish to do
so. Typically, an archive of the source code of the current version of the software should be included with the
submitted manuscript as a supplementary file. Since it is likely that the software will continue to be developed
following publication, the manuscript should also include a link to the home page for the software project. For
open source projects, we recommend that authors host their project with a recognized open-source repository such as
[gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com), [github.com](https://github.com),
[bioinformatics.org](http://bioinformatics.org/) or
[sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/).

Descriptions of websites and web-based tools should be submitted as Software articles if the intention is that the
software that drives the website will be made available to other researchers to extend and use on other websites. On
the other hand, if a website's functionality is closely tied to a specific database then the article should instead
be submitted as a Database article. 

**Graphical abstract**

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the reader with a visual
description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical abstract should be 920 x 300 pixels and a
maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are encouraged to make judicious use of colour in graphical abstracts.
All graphical abstracts should have a white background and where possible should fill the available width.

**Citation Typing Ontology pilot**

The _Journal of Cheminformatics_ welcomes authors to participate in our pilot using the Citation Typing Ontology
([http://purl.org/spar/cito](http://purl.org/spar/cito)). For more information, please see
