**_Journal of Cheminformatics_ will only publish research or software that is entirely reproducible by third parties.
This means that any datasets, software and algorithms that are required to reach the conclusions stated in the
paper must be provided as supplemental materials, or be otherwise accessible without the need for registration,
login or agreement with license terms other than Creative Commons licenses for data and text and
[OSI-approved Open Source Licenses](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)
for software. For any software, the source code must be provided.**

Database articles should describe a novel database likely to be of broad utility. The database must be readily
accessible and data within the database should be attributed to a source.

An article describing a database but also including research that merits publication in its own right should either
be submitted as a Research article or should be split into a Research article and a separate Database.

The Database described in the manuscript must be available for testing by reviewers in a way that preserves their
anonymity. If published, the described databases must be accessible by any researcher wishing to use them for
non-commercial purposes, without restrictions such as the need for a material transfer agreement. We may require
an archive copy of the database to be held by BiomedCentral as a safeguard.

Database articles should include an abstract that does not exceed 350 words.

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the reader with a
visual description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical abstract should be 920 x 300
pixels and a maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are encouraged to make judicious use of colour in
graphical abstracts. All graphical abstracts should have a white background and where possible should fill the
available width.
