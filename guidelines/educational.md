# Criteria
Journal of Cheminformatics publishes Educational articles that describe an aspect of cheminformatics. This aspect may be about cheminformatics theory and methods, but also like a tutorial explaining in detail how to perform a specific cheminformatics task. While the Journal of Cheminformatics will only publish research or software that taken an open science approach, this is particularly true for educational articles. All algorithms, data, and source code needed to follow the material to the end should be open. This means that any datasets, software and algorithms that are required must be provided as supplemental materials, or be otherwise accessible without the need for registration, login. If agreenment with a license is required, authors should ensure that such licenses  allow use, modification, and redistribution. Examples of such licenses are Creative Commons licenses for data and text and OSI-approved Open Source Licenses for software.

Educational articles can roughly be divided into two categories:

* Articles that describe in detail how common cheminformatics tasks can be performed using a particular open source toolkit. Data, standards, and code used in this type must be fully open source.

* Articles that describe in detail a cheminformatics algorithms, must provide enough detail that it can be fully implemented with open source software. Data and standards used in this type must be fully open source.

# Preparing your manuscript

## Title page

The title page should:

* present a title that includes, if appropriate, the research design

* list the full names and institutional addresses for all authors​​​​​​​

** if a collaboration group should be listed as an author, please list the Group name as an author and include the names of the individual members of the Group in the “Acknowledgements” section in accordance with the instructions below

* indicate the corresponding author

## Abstract

The abstract should briefly summarize the aim and anticipated outcome of the article. Please minimize the use of abbreviations and do not cite references in the abstract. See the criteria section for this article type (located at the top of this page) for information on abstract and article word limits.

## Keywords

Three to ten keywords representing the main content of the article.

## Introduction

The Introduction section should explain the background to the work such as the problem that is considered by the tutorial or exposition and why it is important.

## Aims

This section shoud explicitly describe what the reader should gain after reading the article or following the described workflow. The gain can be a specific skill or understanding of a process or method.

## Methods and Materials

This section should indicate the necessary software and data required to understand and/or complete the expository material. This should include links to the appropriate sites along with any necessary instructions to enable the reader to reproduce the methods described in the article.

## List of abbreviations

If abbreviations are used in the text they should be defined in the text at first use, and a list of abbreviations should be provided.
