**_Journal of Cheminformatics_ publishes Educational articles that describe an aspect of cheminformatics. This aspect may be about cheminformatics theory and methods, but also like a tutorial explaining in detail how to perform some cheminformatics. Journal of Cheminformatics will only publish research or software that taken an open science approach and that is entirely reproducible by third parties. All algorithms, data, and source code needed to follow the paper to the end should be open. This means that any datasets, software and algorithms that are required must be provided as supplemental materials, or be otherwise accessible without the need for registration, login or agreement with open license terms that allow use, modification, and redistribution, such as the Creative Commons licenses for data and text and OSI-approved Open Source Licenses for software.**

Educational articles can roughly be divided into two categories:

* Articles that describe in detail how common cheminformatics tasks can be performed using a particular open source toolkit. Data, standards, and code used in this type must be fully open source.
* Articles that describe in detail a cheminformatics algorithms, must provide enough detail that it can be fully implemented with open source software. Data and standards used in this type must be fully open source.
