Meeting report should focus on the key developments presented and discussed at the meeting and are intended to rely
largely on the work described at the meeting, rather than being fully referenced accounts of a field.

For particularly large meetings it is preferable that more in-depth information is given on a few selected topics,
rather than a brief account of absolutely everything presented. The main content of the Meeting report should focus
on new research discoveries and the application of this knowledge.

Meeting reports should be between 600 to 1200 words with a short, unstructured, single paragraph abstract of 25-40
words giving an indication of the meeting on which the report is based; if it is based on one symposium at a big
meeting, say so here. On first mention the meeting should be referred to in the style 'the 39th annual meeting of the
American Society for Cell Biology, Washington DC, December 11-15, 1999'.

Meeting reports are usually commissioned but reports and suggestions may also be submitted for the editors' consideration.

A graphical abstract can be supplied which, together with the article title, should provide the reader with a visual
description of the type of chemistry covered in the article. The graphical abstract should be 920 x 300 pixels and a
maximum of 150KB jpeg, png or svg file. Authors are encouraged to make judicious use of colour in graphical abstracts.
All graphical abstracts should have a white background and where possible should fill the available width.
